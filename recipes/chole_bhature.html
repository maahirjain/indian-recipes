            <li>Allow the steam to escape before opening the lid. Remove the tea powder tied in muslin cloth and drain the kabuli chana. Keep aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a deep non-stick pan and add the cumin seeds. Sauté on a medium flame for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add the onions, ginger and garlic and sauté on a medium flame for 1 to 2 minute or till the onions turn translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the chole masala, chilli powder, dried mango powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin seeds powder, salt and 1 cup of water, mix well and cook on a medium flame for 1 to 2 minutes, while stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add the kabuli chana, mix well and cook on a medium flame for 5 to 7 minutes, while stirring occasionally. Mash the kabuli chana once lightly with a help of a masher. Switch off the flame, keep aside.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>For the Bhature</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the flour, potatoes, curd, oil and salt and knead to make a soft dough using enough water.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough with a wet muslin cloth and rest the dough for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 8 equal portions and roll each portion into a 150 mm. (6") diameter circle using a little plain flour for rolling.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a deep non-stick pan and deep-fry the bhatures, one at a time, till they turn golden brown in color from both sides.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>How to Proceed to Serve the Chole Bhature</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Serve hot bhatures immediately with the chole, sliced onion and lemon wedges.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Handy Tips</h2>

            <li>While frying the bhature, press the centre lightly with a frying spoon so as to help it to puff up.</li>
