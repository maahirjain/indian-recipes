        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A delicious Bengali dessert, consisting of super-soft milk-white balls soaked in sugary water.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>For the Base Milk of the Rasgulla</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups cow's milk</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups buffalo's milk</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Other Ingredients for the Rasgulla</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <h3>For the Base Milk of the Rasgulla</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the cow's milk and buffalo's milk in a deep non-stick pan and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Switch of the flame and wait for 1 minute, while stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add the lemon juice gradually and keep stirring gently.</li>
            <li>Allow it to stand for Â½ minute to curdle. It is completely curdled, when the chenna and the whey (greenish water) separate out.</li>
            <li>Strain using a muslin cloth. Discard or store the whey.</li>
            <li>Place the muslin cloth with the chenna in a bowl of fresh water and wash it 2 to 3 times.</li>
            <li>Tie and hang for 30 minutes for the extra water to drain out.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>How to Proceed to Make the Rasgulla</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put 5 cups of water in a steamer or a pressure cooker, add the sugar and bring to a boil, while stirring occasionally so that the sugar dissolves completely.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, squeeze the muslin cloth to drain any more water remaining.</li>
            <li>Place the muslin cloth on a flat plate, open it and knead the chenna very well using your palms for 3 to 4 minutes or till the chenna is smooth and free of lumps.</li>
            <li>Divide the chenna into 16 equal portions and roll each portion into small balls between your palms.</li>
            <li>Put the chenna balls into the sugar water and cover and steam for 7 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Switch off the flame and allow it to stand in the steamer for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove rasgullas gently into a bowl, refrigerate and serve chilled.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>A Handy Tip</h2>
        <p>If buffalo's milk is not available you can make the recipe using 5 cups of cow's milk.</p>
